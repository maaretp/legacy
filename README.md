# legacy
The legacy project - my collection of writings, slides and articles. 

Everything in this repo is licensed with **Creative Commons Attribution** to allow for reuse of the knowledge I have been collecting over three decades. 

## Talks

This folder includes my past talks as they were whenever the material is shareable, in the legacy template. Currently moving through year 2004.

## Talks to articles

This folder includes my more recent talks, with accompanying articles I post on dev.to. There's only so many times one can deliver a talk, so I prefer writing the storyline down.

## Courses

I have full courses on various topics. The most recent and decently packaged one is Exploratory Testing Foundations, but I work to get others packaged too.

## Exercises

This folder will hold guides to exercises, like how I run coverage exercise around Gilded Rose or assess Testing Hats to share versatility of tasks in testing in a team.
