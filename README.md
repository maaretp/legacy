# maaretp Digital Legacy
The legacy project - my collection of writings, slides and articles.

Everything in this repo is licensed with **Creative Commons Attribution** to allow for reuse of the knowledge I have been collecting over three decades.

## What Is This?

I am turning 50 and while in full health, processing the fact that I am in fact getting older. I have a life's work of learning about software and then showing up to talk about it, and for 20 years already, I have been publishing my materials with Creative Commons Attribution -license. Publishing in the sense that people would need to ask me for what is on my drive, and frankly that is not the mess I want to leave behind in case I was not around to deal with it myself.

I framed the use of this license for two purposes 20 years ago:

* There is no better way for me to have access to my captured materials when changing jobs than having them available with a license
* Instead of finding new ways of drawing testing pyramids and V-models, perhaps reuse could allow us to create new insights into testing instead

## Contents

### Talks

This folder includes my past talks as they were whenever the material is shareable, in the legacy template. Currently moving through year 2004.

### Talks to articles

This folder includes my more recent talks, with accompanying articles I post on dev.to. There's only so many times one can deliver a talk, so I prefer writing the storyline down.

### Courses

I have full courses on various topics. The most recent and decently packaged one is Exploratory Testing Foundations, but I work to get others packaged too.

### Exercises

This folder will hold guides to exercises, like how I run coverage exercise around Gilded Rose or assess Testing Hats to share versatility of tasks in testing in a team.
