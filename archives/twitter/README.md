# My Twitter Archive

When I deleted my twitter account, I archived all of my tweets with wayback machine. However, that is not a helpful format for me to go through the day to day notes of insights that I have had on testing over the years. I use this twitter archive as a way of processing through what I have learned, and like having deleted all my direct messages before first push, will delete things from this archive as I process them. 

I don't delete to erase and forget, even though I know my timeline has two things I would prefer erased and forgotten on most days. But those experiences, no matter how negative, are a part of me and my learning journey.
