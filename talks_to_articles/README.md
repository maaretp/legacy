# Talks to Articles

With limited bandwidth to do talks as I have real work (tm) to do, I aspire to turn my talks to articles and publish them on dev.to. In case that company goes down (as many have over the years of me writing), I keep a copy of the article and the slides here.

The slides are Creative Common Attribution -licensed. The articles are Creative Common Attribution Non-Commercial. I prefer being asked before my articles are published to promote someone's business.
