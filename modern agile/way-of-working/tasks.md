# Conversational Approach to Tasks

## Principles 

Principle 1: In doing the work we discover the work that needs to be done. We don’t create tasks to update their details, we create pull requests describing changes. 
Tasks are created when we know the least. Pull requests are created when we know the most. We share when we know the most, and learn in conversations when we know the least.

Principle 2: Pair and ensemble programming are encouraged. Creating a better solution (and better team members) is investment we believe in and act upon. 
Thus tasks are often shared and have ownership (team) but not single owner. Helping others complete the highest priority items is what team optimises for.

# Practice

While scoping and prioritising:

* Team doesn’t go into the details but try to have conversations both on what is the next clear steps and when we think this epic might be done. Details are discussed in pairs and 
small groups on teams' channel calls that are not meetings but collaborative working sessions.

While delivering:

* Team creates merge requests that nudge capability forward with goal of not breaking existing functionality. 
* Team uses UI last -principle and UI feature toggles to hide unfinished features to keep baseline at most a few days from release quality. 
* Team does not use pull request blocking reviews but reserves time for regularly revisiting (reviewing for knowledge sharing purposes) last week’s changes tested with green pipelines the merge requests enable
* Asking for pairing or review is done on developer discretion, remembering that we don't leave people alone making risky changes
