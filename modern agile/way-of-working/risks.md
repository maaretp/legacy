# Risks

## Principles

Principle 1: Risk management is a continuous process that shows up as rescoping work to releases. 

Principle 2: Conversational approach to risk management includes senior member collaboration, weekly Leadership sync meeting and monthly steering group meeting

## Practice

In managing the development effort:

* Team has conversations on development (project) risks and product (hazard, value) risks and scope actions into the work of the team
* Significant risks are discussed and mediated in leadership sync meetings 

In steering the development effort:

* Team brings risks requiring steering group attention to the monthly agenda
