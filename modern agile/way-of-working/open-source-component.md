# Open Source Licenses and Vulnerabilities

Principle 1: OSS Licenses are verified at release time based on changes to update components. 

Principle 2: OSS versions we release with are not older than 3 months in general. 
Exceptions are major version changes where we delay compatibility work at most to 1 year. 
While we cannot control when customer install a version with less vulnerabilities, we can make a version available.

# Practice 

While Delivering:

* Team upgrades component versions regularly and checks licenses as new components are added- A release-time verification for licenses is done as part of release procedure.
