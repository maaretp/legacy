# DoR and DoD

## Principles

Principle 1: No artificial or role based separation of discovery and delivery phases. While DoR (Definition of Ready) completes 
discovery and DoD (Definition of Done) completes delivery, we move fluently from discovery to delivery within a theme and use 
these concepts to understand how far are we. We recognise both phases require work from the same people. 

Principle 2: Main readiness (DoR) criteria applied is technical proof of concept. Without technical proof of concept, we are still in discovery. 

Principle 3: Discovering work while doing the work is expected. Team works together to have less to discover through 
smaller epics with clear small steps from existing baseline. 

## Practice

In Discovery:

* Team reads input material and clarifies and documents scope with acceptance criteria
* Team uses Definition of Ready as proposal on the types of conversations to have. 

In Delivery:

* Team uses Release Definition of Done to as condensed release review template
* Team does not use Story Definition of Done is close to a story and this checklist is used as proposal on the types of conversations to have continuously.
