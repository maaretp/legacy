# Estimating work

## Principles

Principle 1: Business management commits to Long-Term Estimates. Since management holds reprioritization power, risk taking and customer negotiations of scope, management commits to project level costs. 

Principle 2: Team optimises investment to value. Team seeks to find smaller slice of work towards value and does best work possible in the slices that are reflected in work targeted for next two weeks.

## Approach 

When estimating new concepts and customer projects:

* Team provides input on work from a technical perspective
* Business representative outside team commit to project estimates presented forward

When estimating ongoing work:

* Team does not estimate amount of work but splits the work to next minimal and necessary slice of value asking ‘can we make this smaller’
* Team sums up and models the remaining work to track estimates
