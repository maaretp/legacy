# Improving Way of Working

## Principles

Principle 1: Continuous retrospectives. Suffering from problems to wait for scheduled time to talk about them is not what we do. 

Principle 2: Regular time allocations to make space for improvement conversations. While we improve continuously, we also invest in improving.

## Practice

While in scheduled retrospective:

* Team reserves 55 minutes every two weeks to discuss observations that could lead to improvements
* Team documents the retrospective core insights and improvements as event snapshot to retrospectives page
* Team tracks open agreed improvement items and reviews if they can be removed from list at start of each scheduled retrospective

While noticing improvements continuously:

* Team proposes improvements as soon as they think of them on channel if they require immediate improvement
* Team adds conversation topics on retro board to remember conversations that can be postponed to a scheduled retrospective
