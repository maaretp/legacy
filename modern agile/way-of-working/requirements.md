# Requirements

## Principles 
Principle 1: Requirements are approved at release time and documented. Calling a note 'requirement' does not make it one, mutual review and agreement does. 

Principle 2: In doing the work, we discover the work that needs to be done. Scope does not creep, understanding grows. This happens 
in close collaboration the team uses a conversational approach where up to date documentation is the output. 

## Practice 
While Discovering: 
* Named responsible adds a title describing the required product capability on a listing
* Named responsible characterises expectations with confluence pages describing specification details in business language and links these expectations to the epic

While Refining:
* Team reviews characterised expectations and suggests limitations to scope

While Delivering:
* Team designs and delivers changes that fit the intended expectations and scope
* Team tracks scope by collecting acceptance criteria and marks tested acceptance criteria with a green tick :check_mark: 
* Team closes item when all work linked to it have been completed to indicate readiness for release for capability described
