# Non-Blocking Code Reviews

Principle 1: Ship - Show - Ask. In majority of cases, we don’t expect a pull request to get code review before merge. We give the power to decide 
on the individual change maker on which of the three options for 2nd pair of eyes they use and reflect on mistakes by taking weekly time to learn changes made in the codebase. 

Principle 2: 2nd pair of Eyes. We prefer to time the review when it matters the most, by pairing, asking or showing. We seek to 
never leave a colleague alone with the responsibility of making changes that is team-owned. 

## Practice

While working on code:

* Team pulls other team members into conversations about designs and changes to previously captured developer intent in the tests
* Team collaborates by discussion, pair programs or ensemble programs to have continuous code reviews

While merging a pull request:

* Team creates a pull request and merges it to master as soon as the PR creator wants without waiting for approvals on the pull request

Weekly on individual developer schedules:

* Team reviews last week’s pull requests for title level changes, reviews for learning purposes and reviews if risk is identified on making changes conflicting with existing intent. 

On retrospectives:

* Team discusses quality related escapes that could be found with better code level collaboration and takes actions to improve without gating reviews
