# Modern Agile Way of Working Sample

## Value Statements Capturing Ideas that Drive Us

* *No product owner* - product owned by team, with shared ownership
* *Nothing changes if we change nothing* - bias to moving forward to better over extensive planning
* *On-time planning* - plan details just before plan is executed, but plan for themes continuously
* *Collaborating* with others over individual productivity
* *Documentation* as output - writing documentation at time we know the most, as things we leave behind for our future selves
* *Socialize over documenting* for process - share way of working by working this way together, including all team members; follow behaviors expected over following rules. 
* *Value over compliance*. There is always reasons on why we have compliance rules in place. Go back to discussing the value we seek a compliance activity to create. 
* *Proposed requirements become requirements at time of 1st release* of them. They are a result of negotiation under constraints of design. 

## Some Agreements We Considered Worth Writing Down

Team holds information of work. Using a tracker is allowed but not compulsory.  Team shares all responsibilities and has 
identified rotating responsibilities: continuous improvement, product/team capabilities tracking, investment tracking, 
system quality/testing; library liasoning; architecture; and software security. 

Priorities for interrupting ongoing work / starting new work are negotiated every two weeks. 

The team delivers in kanban style, working on the topmost priorities without commitment other than doing best possible work within the priorities. 
When a major technical uncertainty is identified, a spike is used to assess feasibility before the work. 

If we write something down before the work, we write something to hold the framing of the delivery item. Documentation details are output of the work and updated by the team by time of delivering 
with a release. The team tracks tested acceptance criteria and links exploratory or cucumber test cases to the epic as evidence of testing. 

If someone writes things to remember details by, we address the notes before closing the item. Moving things out of scope is a way of addressing things. Tasks are created with conversational 
approach, and documented as pull requests introducing the change. The documentation is an output of the work, written at time we should know the most from the conversations. 

Bugs are divided to unfinished work and customer bugs. Only customer bugs are logged and tracked. Unfinished work is tracked per epic with conversational approach and team agreement is 
that in addition to to fixing problems identified, they are also documented where applicable with improving programmatic tests. 

Programmatic tests are always run with pipelines, and kept green. In addition to programmatic tests, team uses test automation for monitoring end-user -like deployments. 

Pull requests can be merged to mainline without waiting for review. Reviews are done asynchronously to share information as part of conversational approach. In case of significant uncertainty on risk of change, 
ask to pair and/or request a review.

Team follows a few metrics: Monthly pull requests; Test coverage with goal of increased trend over releases; and % of green merges to mainline; Release lead time; Release frequency; Release failure rate

Team uses ceremonies to synch work: priorities planning every two weeks; demo every two weeks; retrospective every two weeks; architecture/design collaboration every week; unfinished work review every week; 
daily every day skipping days when planning-demo-retro or architecture/design collaboration session. 

Team pulls others in conversation whenever planning is useful.

Communication (incl. group calls) are done on teamâ€™s channel. Each interaction leaves behind a visible note others can use to ask about conclusions.
